# Alarm-Clock
Being a beginner it’s critical to work in the right direction. To master a programming language, you should work on projects. In this tutorial, we will develop a basic python project – An alarm clock with a ringtone play feature with the console interface.  

About the Python Project:
The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime, playsound, and winsound which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a console interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 12-hour format.

Prerequisites:
This project requires good knowledge of Python Basics and Working experience with Pycharm. All the modules used need not be downloaded beforehand like the other libraries like playsound, thus this project will be user-friendly and accessible in any virtual environment used for python programming.
